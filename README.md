**Abstract**: This work describes one successful and one failed Voice Cloning processes of two famous personalities 
in order to be broadcast in a high-impact podcast and in a Spanish public television program. 
Whilst a good quality synthesised voice could be generated for the first public figure, the second one was not adequate enough 
for its broadcast on television given its low speech quality. In this study, we explore the limits of the neural voice cloning 
considering the different conditions of the training material employed in each case and, based on several objective measures 
(volume of data, phoneme occurrence, SNR, PESQ and MCD), we analysed the main features to be considered for a high-quality synthetic voice generation.
